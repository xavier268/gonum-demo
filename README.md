# nn

My personnal Neural Network package based upon gonum.

* direct implementation of a bacpropagation algorithm, based solely on linear algebra (gonum)
* validation of the backprop by direct computation of the gradient
* demo validation on the iris dataset

This was primarily developped as a practice exercise with gonum, the linear algebra package for golang.
