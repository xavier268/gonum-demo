# nn

My personnal Neural Network package based upon gonum.

* direct implementation of a backpropagation algorithm, based solely on linear algebra (gonum)
* validation of the backprop by direct (slow) computation of the gradient
* demo implementation on the iris dataset

This was primarily developped as a practice exercise with gonum, the linear algebra package for golang.
